## [0.7.1] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed

- **Email template variables**: Added `stripTemplateVars()` regex filter that removes any bracketed
  placeholders (`[Your Name]`, `[Company Name]`, etc.) from LLM-generated email content.
  Even when the system prompt says "never include these", LLMs sometimes slip them in.
  This post-processing filter catches them all.
- **HN scraper broken**: HN's Algolia search API started returning HTML instead of JSON
  (rate-limiting). Rewrote to use Firebase user endpoint (`/user/whoishiring.json`).
  Added Algolia fallback with Content-Type check to avoid JSON parse errors.

### Added

- **Scraper constructors**: `NewLinkedInSource()` and `NewRedditSource()` restore build
  after partial merge. Reddit stubs search across r/LocalLLaMA, r/MachineLearning, etc.

### Changed

- **Blog engine rewritten**: 28 diverse topics (was 8), each with 3 angle variations.
  JSON state persistence prevents duplicates. Max tokens 3000.
- **Dashboard**: Pipeline funnel bar replaces text summary.
- **Systray**: Added Open Blog, Open Site, Restart Service menu items.
- **Project**: Scripts archived to `scripts/archive/`.
