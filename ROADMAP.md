## COMPLETED: Phase 6 — Production Hardening & Reliability

### 6.1 Test Coverage & Quality
- [x] **Fix CRLF line-ending test failure** in `internal/gitres/resolve_test.go` (`TestResolveConflictTheirs`)
- [x] **Add connection pool configuration** to `db.NewDB()` (max open/idle conns, lifetime)
- [x] **Add graceful shutdown** with drain timeouts for all background workers (scraper, enricher, researcher, CRM, comm, autodev, deploy)
- [x] **Add integration tests with ephemeral DB** for `enrichment/worker`, `researcher`, `crm/worker`, and `communication/manager` (currently only `db` and `e2e` have integration tests)
- [x] **Add web dashboard handler tests** for `/` route, webhook endpoint, and form actions (currently only `/health` is tested)
- [x] **Add negative/error-path unit tests** for `db/repository.go` (currently only happy-path integration tests exist)
- [x] **Add test coverage reporting** to CI pipeline (e.g., `go test -coverprofile` + artifact upload)

### 6.2 Database & Data Integrity
- [x] **Add `contacts.email` NULL constraint fix** — currently `UNIQUE` allows multiple NULL emails which may cause duplicate contact issues
- [x] **Add `interactions.success` index** for efficient `ListSuccessfulInteractions` queries
- [x] **Add `deals(current_state)` index** for efficient `ListDealsByState` queries
- [x] **Add migration for `audit_log` table** to track state transitions with who/when/why metadata
- [x] **Add `deleted_at` soft-delete column** to companies, contacts, and deals for GDPR compliance
- [x] **Add database migration runner** to application startup (auto-apply pending migrations on boot)

### 6.3 Configuration & Environment
- [x] **Add structured configuration** — replace scattered `os.Getenv()` calls with a typed config struct (e.g., `Config{DatabaseURL, GitHubToken, CRMAPIKey, SyncInterval, ...}`)
- [x] **Add `.env` file loading** via `godotenv` or equivalent for local development
- [x] **Add config validation at startup** — fail fast with clear error messages if required env vars are missing
- [x] **Add configurable worker intervals** — currently hardcoded in `main.go`, should be overridable via env vars

### 6.4 Logging & Observability
- [x] **Add structured JSON logging** — replace all `log.Printf` with a leveled, structured logger (e.g., `slog` or `zerolog`)
- [x] **Add Prometheus metrics endpoint** (`/metrics`) — expose counters for leads discovered, interactions processed, deals won/lost, PRs merged, etc.
- [x] **Add correlation/request IDs** to all log lines for traceability
- [x] **Add pprof endpoint** for production debugging (`/debug/pprof/`)

### 6.5 Error Handling & Resilience
- [x] **Add retry with exponential backoff** to all external API calls (GitHub, CRM, Stripe)
- [x] **Add circuit breaker** for external integrations (CRM, Stripe, GitHub API)
- [x] **Add dead-letter tracking** — persist failed interactions/updates for manual review instead of silently dropping errors
- [x] **Add health check dependencies** — detailed health endpoint should report each worker's last successful run timestamp

## Phase 7 — Real Integrations & Multi-Channel Outreach

### 7.1 Real Enrichment Providers
- [x] **Implement Apollo.io API enrichment source** (replace mock)
- [x] **Implement Hunter.io email finder** as secondary enrichment source

### 7.2 Real Communication Channels
- [x] **Implement SMTP email sender** for outbound outreach (replace mock)
- [x] **Implement IMAP/POP3 email polling** for inbound message ingestion
- [x] **Implement LinkedIn message sending** via headless automation

- [x] **Add channel preference logic** — route outreach via the contact's preferred channel
- [x] **Add outreach cadence management** — configurable follow-up schedule (e.g., Day 1 → Day 3 → Day 7)

### 7.3 Real LLM Integration
- [x] **Implement OpenAI/Anthropic LLM provider** (replace mock)
- [x] **Add provider fallback chain** for LLM calls (primary → secondary → tertiary)
- [x] **Add token budget tracking** per deal/contact to control costs
- [x] **Add prompt versioning** — store and track prompt templates with A/B testing capability
- [x] **Add response quality scoring** — auto-evaluate generated responses before sending

### 7.4 Real CRM Integration
- [x] **Implement Salesforce CRM adapter** (replace generic REST mock)
- [x] **Implement HubSpot CRM adapter** as alternative
- [x] **Add CRM field mapping configuration** — map local fields to CRM-specific schema

## Phase 8 — Intelligence & Autonomous Evolution

### 8.1 Advanced Lead Intelligence
- [x] **Implement real GitHub repository analysis** — detect tech stack, architecture patterns, and bottlenecks from actual source code
- [x] **Implement real technical blog/RSS ingestion** — parse engineering blogs for hiring signals and pain points
- [x] **Add competitor intelligence** — track when targets evaluate or adopt competing solutions
- [x] **Add intent signal aggregation** — combine hiring signals, GitHub activity, blog posts, and job postings into a unified intent score

### 8.2 Autonomous Development Improvements
- [ ] **Replace hardcoded `LocalAgent.ProposeSolution`** with LLM-powered code generation
- [ ] **Add rollback mechanism** — if verification fails, revert to pre-change state
- [ ] **Add PR feedback loop** — use `GetPRComments` to refine the agent's code generation accuracy
- [ ] **Add task dependency resolution** — respect ordering between tasks (e.g., DB migration before feature code)
- [ ] **Add concurrent task execution** — process independent tasks in parallel goroutines

### 8.3 Advanced Sales Strategy
- [x] **Add multi-touch outreach sequences** — define and execute cadenced sequences across channels
- [x] **Add A/B testing for outreach templates** — track conversion per template variant
- [x] **Add objection handling library** — curated rebuttals indexed by objection type with success rates
- [x] **Add human-in-the-loop approval workflow** — require explicit approval for deals above a configurable threshold
- [x] **Add deal forecasting** — predict close probability and expected revenue using historical patterns

### 8.4 Self-Improving Prompts v2
- [ ] **Add A/B prompt testing** — compare outreach generated with vs. without successful examples
- [x] **Add interaction sentiment analysis** — auto-classify sentiment of inbound messages to refine strategy
- [ ] **Add prompt performance tracking** — measure response quality over time as few-shot examples accumulate
- [ ] **Add negative example injection** — learn from failed outreach (flagged `success=false`) to avoid repeated patterns

- [ ] **Add Redis caching layer** for frequently accessed data (company lookups, performance metrics)
