# EXECUTIVE PROTOCOL HANDOFF — Session 2026-06-25

## Completed Operations

### Repository Sync

- Fetched all remote branches and tags
- All 8 feature branches have 0 unique commits since `main` — all fully merged
- Reverse-merged `main` into all active branches to prevent drift

### Site Deployments

| Site | Changes |
|---|---|
| **hypernexus.site** | Light luxury theme, neon animated gradient splashes, frosted glass cards, $5/seat pricing, self-host redirect, NotebookLM video embed, canvas/overflow/scroll fixed |
| **tormentnexus.site** | Skull jaw lowered + grin widened, nose shifted down, nasal cavity shrunk inward, hero padding reduced, both jaws adjusted |

### Version

- **0.5.2 → 0.5.3**
- CHANGELOG updated with all recent changes

### Pending / Known Issues

- `borg` submodule has modified content (not committed — separate repo)
- `.memory/branches/main/log.md` has local changes (gitignored for secrets)
- git `stash` may have an entry from earlier cherry-pick attempts

### Next Steps for Next Agent

1. Verify hypernexus.site is fully functional (no blank scroll, gradients animate, video plays)
2. Verify tormentnexus.site skull animations render correctly
3. Push remaining submodule updates if borg is ready
